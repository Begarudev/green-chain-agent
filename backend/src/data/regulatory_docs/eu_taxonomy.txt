EU Taxonomy Regulation for Environmentally Sustainable Economic Activities

The EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable. This applies to green lending in agriculture.

ARTICLE 3 - ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES

An economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable if it:
1. Contributes substantially to one or more of the following environmental objectives:
   - Climate change mitigation
   - Climate change adaptation
   - Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
   - Transition to a circular economy
   - Pollution prevention and control
   - Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems

2. Does not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives listed above

3. Is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards (human rights, labor rights)

ARTICLE 4 - SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION CRITERIA FOR AGRICULTURE

4.1 Climate Change Mitigation
- Activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Practices that enhance carbon sequestration in soils
- Transition to low-carbon farming methods
- Renewable energy use in agricultural operations

4.2 Climate Change Adaptation
- Implementation of climate-resilient farming practices
- Use of drought-resistant crop varieties
- Water-efficient irrigation systems
- Weather risk management strategies

4.3 Biodiversity Protection
- Maintenance of natural habitats
- Protection of endangered species
- Avoidance of deforestation and land conversion
- Sustainable land management practices

4.4 Water Resource Management
- Efficient water use and conservation
- Prevention of water pollution
- Protection of water quality
- Sustainable irrigation practices

ARTICLE 5 - DO NO SIGNIFICANT HARM (DNSH) PRINCIPLE

Economic activities must not:
- Cause significant harm to climate change mitigation or adaptation
- Lead to degradation of water or marine resources
- Increase waste generation or reduce recycling
- Cause significant pollution
- Harm biodiversity or ecosystems

For agricultural loans, this means:
- No deforestation or habitat destruction
- No excessive use of harmful pesticides or fertilizers
- No water pollution or over-extraction
- No soil degradation or erosion
- No harm to protected species or areas

ARTICLE 6 - MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS

Activities must comply with:
- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
- UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
- International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions
- Applicable national and international law

ARTICLE 7 - TECHNICAL SCREENING CRITERIA

7.1 Quantitative Thresholds
- Minimum sustainability performance indicators
- Measurable environmental impact metrics
- Verifiable compliance requirements
- Regular monitoring and reporting

7.2 Verification Methods
- Satellite-based monitoring (NDVI, land-use change)
- On-ground assessments and audits
- Third-party verification where applicable
- Transparent reporting and disclosure

ARTICLE 8 - DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

Financial institutions must disclose:
- Proportion of taxonomy-aligned activities
- Environmental performance metrics
- Compliance with technical screening criteria
- Methodology for assessment

For green lending:
- Percentage of loans meeting taxonomy criteria
- Aggregate environmental impact
- Carbon footprint reduction
- Biodiversity protection measures

ARTICLE 9 - TRANSITIONAL ACTIVITIES

Activities that do not yet meet full taxonomy criteria but:
- Support transition to sustainable practices
- Have credible transition plans
- Show measurable progress over time
- Do not lock in carbon-intensive infrastructure

This includes:
- Farms transitioning to organic methods
- Implementation of sustainable irrigation systems
- Adoption of climate-resilient practices
- Gradual reduction of chemical inputs
