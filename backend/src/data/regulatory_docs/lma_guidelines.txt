- Carbon sequestration potential

2. LOAN APPROVAL PROCESS

2.1 Documentation Requirements
- Farm location coordinates and boundary mapping
- Historical NDVI data (minimum 6 months)
- Deforestation risk assessment (2-year analysis)

- Sustainability score breakdown

2.2 Risk Assessment
- Vegetation health trends (improving/stable/declining)
- Deforestation detection (automatic rejection if detected)
